# Web Scraper System Architecture

## 1. System Overview and Goals

### 1.1 Purpose
The Web Scraper is a robust, scalable system designed to efficiently extract, process, and store data from web pages. It provides a reliable foundation for web data collection while being extensible for various use cases.

### 1.2 Key Goals
- Efficient and reliable web data extraction
- Scalable architecture supporting concurrent scraping
- Respect for website terms of service and robots.txt
- Flexible data extraction patterns
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Maintainable and extensible codebase

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 URL Manager
- Manages the queue of URLs to be scraped
- Implements prioritization logic
- Handles URL deduplication
- Tracks crawling history
- Enforces crawling policies

### 2.2 Crawler Component
- Handles HTTP requests and responses
- Manages connection pools
- Implements retry logic
- Respects robots.txt rules
- Handles rate limiting
- Manages session handling and cookies

### 2.3 Parser Engine
- Extracts data using configurable patterns
- Supports multiple parsing strategies (CSS, XPath, Regex)
- Handles different content types (HTML, JSON, XML)
- Provides data validation
- Implements data cleaning and normalization

### 2.4 Data Storage System
- Stores extracted data in structured format
- Manages data versioning
- Handles concurrent writes
- Provides data export capabilities
- Implements data backup strategies

### 2.5 Job Manager
- Orchestrates scraping jobs
- Manages job scheduling
- Handles job prioritization
- Provides job status tracking
- Implements failure recovery

## 3. Data Flow

```
[URL Manager] → [Crawler] → [Parser] → [Data Storage]
     ↑             ↓           ↓            ↓
     └────────[Job Manager]────────────────┘
```

### 3.1 Flow Description
1. Job Manager initiates scraping tasks
2. URL Manager provides prioritized URLs
3. Crawler fetches web pages
4. Parser extracts required data
5. Data Storage persists results
6. Job Manager updates job status

## 4. Component Interactions

### 4.1 Synchronous Operations
- URL validation and normalization
- Basic HTML parsing
- Data validation
- Database operations

### 4.2 Asynchronous Operations
- Web page fetching
- Resource-intensive parsing
- Bulk data storage
- Job status updates

## 5. System Constraints and Requirements

### 5.1 Performance Requirements
- Maximum concurrent connections: Configurable per domain
- Response timeout: 30 seconds default
- Parsing timeout: 60 seconds default
- Storage write timeout: 10 seconds default

### 5.2 System Constraints
- Memory usage limits
- CPU utilization thresholds
- Network bandwidth restrictions
- Storage capacity limits

### 5.3 External Dependencies
- Database system
- HTTP client library
- HTML parsing library
- Queue system

## 6. Error Handling Strategy

### 6.1 Network Errors
- Connection timeouts: Retry with exponential backoff
- DNS failures: Temporary blacklist
- Rate limiting: Adjust crawl rate
- SSL errors: Log and skip

### 6.2 Parsing Errors
- Invalid HTML: Skip and log
- Missing data: Use fallback patterns
- Encoding issues: Apply fixes
- Timeout: Mark for retry

### 6.3 Storage Errors
- Write failures: Retry mechanism
- Corruption: Validation checks
- Capacity issues: Cleanup old data
- Concurrent access: Transaction management

### 6.4 Recovery Mechanisms
- Job checkpointing
- State persistence
- Automatic retry queues
- Manual intervention APIs

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

### 7.1 Key Metrics
- Crawl success rate
- Parse success rate
- Storage performance
- Resource utilization

### 7.2 Logging Levels
- ERROR: System failures
- WARN: Operational issues
- INFO: Status updates
- DEBUG: Detailed operations

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1 Access Control
- API authentication
- Rate limiting
- IP restrictions
- User permissions

### 8.2 Data Protection
- Secure storage
- Data encryption
- Access logging
- Backup protection
