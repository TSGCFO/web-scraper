# Web Scraper Architecture

## Purpose
This project implements a sophisticated web scraping architecture that combines TypeScript-based core scraping functionality with Python-based machine learning capabilities. The system is designed to efficiently collect, process, and analyze web data at scale.

## Problems Solved
1. Scalable Web Data Collection
   - Efficient URL management and prioritization
   - Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Rate limiting and ethical scraping compliance

2. Intelligent Data Processing
   - Machine learning-based data extraction
   - Feature engineering and analysis
   - Anomaly detection and validation

3. System Integration
   - Seamless TypeScript-Python service communication
   - Asynchronous task processing
   - Unified data type system

## Core Functionality
1. Web Scraping Engine (TypeScript)
   - URL management and crawling
   - HTML parsing and data extraction
   - Storage system integration

2. ML Service (Python)
   - Feature extraction pipeline
   - Model training and prediction
   - Data processing and validation

3. Advanced Features
   - Proxy management and rotation
   - JavaScript rendering support
   - CAPTCHA solving capabilities
   - Request management and optimization
